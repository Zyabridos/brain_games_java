## Project Description
This project was created to play a collection of simple mathematical games in the console.
It includes five games, each consisting of three rounds.

## Setup
In order to setup the game, a player should run following commands in the command line:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Zyabridos/brain_games_java
$ make run-dist
```

The main rule is the same for all games:
To win, the player must give three correct answers in a row.
Any wrong answer ends the game immediately.

Each game displays its specific rules after greeting the player.
## Prerequisites
- Java (JDK 17 or later recommended)
- Make (for using Makefile to build and run the project)

## üéÆ How to Play
To play a game, simply type the name of the game you want to play in the console.
Do not use quotation marks.
The list of available games is shown below:

### üß† brain-even
A game where the player must determine if a given number is even or not.

### ‚ûï brain-calc
A game where the player is shown a mathematical expression and must calculate the result.

### üî¢ brain-gcd
A game where the player must find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given numbers.

### üîÅ brain-progression
A game where the player sees an arithmetic progression with one number missing and must find the missing number.

### üîç brain-prime
A game where the player must determine whether a given number is a prime number.
